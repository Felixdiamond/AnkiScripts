## Kanji to Romanji

As a beginner in Japanese, I was trying to learn kanji using a shared deck but it was pretty hard to grasp cause although there were hiragana and katakana translations, I wasn't quite used to them yet and sometimes i had to double check the hiragana translation to romanji to understand the kanji. So I decided to make a script that would translate the kanji to romanji and add it to the deck.

Pretty cool right?
